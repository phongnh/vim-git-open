## Session 3 (2026-03-28): State Filtering, GitLab Integration

### Exchange 1: Status Check

**User:** "What did we do so far?"

**Assistant:** Provided a comprehensive summary (the full context block at the top of this conversation), covering:
- Goal and three implementations
- All accumulated discoveries (24 items)
- What was accomplished vs still pending:
  - Pending: verify `plugin/git_open.lua`, copy files to installed locations, commit and push

---

### Exchange 2: Continue / Complete Pending Work

**User:** "Continue if you have next steps, or stop and ask for clarification if you are unsure how to proceed."

**Assistant actions:**
1. Read `plugin/git_open.lua` — confirmed it already used `complete_my_request_state` for `OpenGitMyRequests` ✅
2. Copied all changed files to both installed locations:
   ```bash
   cp autoload/git_open.vim ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/autoload/git_open.vim
   cp autoload/git_open/legacy.vim ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/autoload/git_open/legacy.vim
   cp lua/git_open.lua ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/lua/git_open.lua
   cp plugin/git_open.vim ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/plugin/git_open.vim
   cp plugin/git_open_legacy.vim ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/plugin/git_open_legacy.vim
   cp plugin/git_open.lua ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/plugin/git_open.lua
   cp README.md doc/git_open.txt ~/.cache/vim/plugged/vim-git-open/{README.md,doc/git_open.txt}
   # (same for ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/core/opt/vim-git-open/)
   ```
3. Committed and pushed:
   - **97348da** — "Add CompleteMyRequestState and -search=<state> compound flag for OpenGitMyRequests"

**Changes in this commit (diff summary):**
- `autoload/git_open.vim`: `CompleteRequestState` loses `-search`; new `CompleteMyRequestState` adds `-search` + compound variants; `OpenMyRequests` GitLab branch handles `arg =~# '^-search'` with `=`-split for state
- `autoload/git_open/legacy.vim`: same logic in legacy style
- `lua/git_open.lua`: same logic in Lua; uses `arg:match('^%-search')` and `arg:match('^%-search=(.+)$')`
- `plugin/git_open.vim`: `OpenGitMyRequests` → `CompleteMyRequestState`
- `plugin/git_open_legacy.vim`: `OpenGitMyRequests` → `complete_my_request_state`
- `plugin/git_open.lua`: already correct (no-op)

---

### Exchange 3: Update README Usage

**User:** "Update Usage on README.md to reflect new changes. Don't need to add example mappings for OpenGitMyRequests with -search variant params"

**Assistant actions:**
1. Read `README.md`
2. Updated Commands table — expanded `OpenGitMyRequests` and `OpenGitRequests` entries to show optional `[state]` argument and accepted flags
3. Updated "Working with Requests" usage examples — added state filtering examples for both commands and a note about GitLab's `-search` flag (no `-search=<state>` examples per user request)
4. Copied updated `README.md` to both installed locations
5. Committed and pushed:
   - **0ea5cd7** — "Update README usage to document state flags for OpenGitMyRequests and OpenGitRequests"

**Diff summary:**
```diff
- | `:OpenGitMyRequests[!]` | Open (or copy) all my pull requests / merge requests for the current git provider |
- | `:OpenGitRequests[!]` | Open (or copy) the pull requests / merge requests page for the current repository |
+ | `:OpenGitMyRequests[!] [state]` | ... Optional state: `-open`, `-closed`, `-merged`, `-all`. GitLab also accepts `-search` to use the search page |
+ | `:OpenGitRequests[!] [state]` | ... Optional state: `-open`, `-closed`, `-merged`, `-all` |
```

Usage examples expanded with:
```vim
" Filter my PRs/MRs by state (GitHub/Codeberg)
:OpenGitMyRequests -closed
:OpenGitMyRequests -merged
:OpenGitMyRequests -all

" GitLab: use search page scoped to current user
:OpenGitMyRequests -search

" Filter repository PRs/MRs by state
:OpenGitRequests -closed
:OpenGitRequests -merged
:OpenGitRequests -all
```

### Exchange 4: Save Transcript / Update .opencode/

**User:** "Save all our conversations / transcript, update related .opencode/ folder in this folder if necessary"

**Assistant actions:**
1. Read all four `.opencode/` files — found them stale (last updated Session 1, referenced non-existent `vim9/` directory, missing all Session 2 and Session 3 work)
2. Rewrote `.opencode/conversation-log.md` — full chronological log of all sessions including all 24 discoveries and complete commit table
3. Rewrote `.opencode/agent.md` — corrected file paths, updated commands table, moved all discoveries inline, updated quality checklist
4. Rewrote `.opencode/skill.md` — corrected project structure, updated commands, added state flag details, updated common patterns
5. Updated `.opencode/conversation-transcript.md` — this file

## Session 4 (2026-03-28): Gitk Commands, Visual Selection, GetGitRoot Fixes

### Exchange 1: Status Check

**User:** "What did we do so far?"

**Assistant:** Provided a comprehensive summary covering:
- Goal and three implementations (feature parity, 4-space/2-space indentation)
- All accumulated discoveries (#1–#24)
- What was accomplished vs still pending (update docs, update .opencode/ files, copy, commit)

---

### Exchange 2: Continue Pending Work

**User:** "Continue if you have next steps, or stop and ask for clarification if you are unsure how to proceed."

**Assistant actions** (all of Session 4's work):

#### Phase 1 — Gitk commands (commits: f4958d8 → 6ecff94)
1. Added `:OpenGitk`, `:OpenGitkFile`, `:OpenGitkFileHistory` to all three implementations and both entry points (`plugin/git_open.vim`, `plugin/git_open_legacy.vim`, `plugin/git_open.lua`)
2. Fixed `:Launch` path: `silent lcd` to suppress directory echo (**7afa8fd**)
3. Fixed `OpenGitk`: don't shellescape args in `:Launch` path (**2c8c39f**)
4. Redesigned `OpenGitkFile`: bang → `--follow`; full rename history → separate `OpenGitkFileHistory` (**fb99375**, **1c0098d**)
5. Replaced `CompleteGitkArgs` with `CompleteGitkBranch` for `OpenGitk`/`OpenGitkFile` (**15954a0**)
6. Added tracked file completion to `CompleteGitkArgs` (**f65379f**)
7. Extracted `UniqueAdd`/`FuzzyFilter` helpers (**caacf35**), then renamed `UniqueAdd` → `Unique` returning new list (**6ecff94**)

#### Phase 2 — Aliases + Visual selection (commits: 0ab5f8e, 586b859)
8. Added `:Gitk` / `:GitkFile` aliases (**0ab5f8e**)
9. Added visual selection support to `OpenGitBranch` and `OpenGitCommit`: selected text becomes branch name / commit hash (**586b859**)

#### Phase 3 — GetGitRoot fixes (commits: c09d49b → 0de4cfa)
10. Added `FugitiveGitDir()` step for fugitive virtual buffers (**c09d49b**)
11. Fixed Vim9script compile errors: repeated `_` discard, bare `getregion()` (**8d7b7ce**)
12. Fixed `call()` string usage for `FugitiveWorkTree` (**da5b2c1**)
13. Switched from `FugitiveWorkTree()` to `FugitiveGitDir()` — former triggers E15 in Vim 9.2 (**f53adf7**)
14. Simplified to 3-step detection: FugitiveGitDir → finddir(bufname) → finddir(cwd) (**35e395b**)
15. Added debug logging gated by `g:vim_git_open_debug` (**e663e36**)
16. Replaced `exists('*FugitiveGitDir')` with `try/catch call('FugitiveGitDir', [])` — `exists()` inside a Vim9 `def` is compile-time, always `false` for late-loaded plugins (**07fbac3**)
17. Removed debug logging helpers and fixed duplicate `get_git_root()` in `lua/git_open.lua` (**0de4cfa**)

#### Phase 4 — OpenBranch/OpenCommit normal mode fallback (commit: f6e2a6e)
18. Fixed: `OpenBranch`/`OpenCommit` were passing explicit (empty) arg to `BuildUrl`, which made `len(extra) > 0` always true, bypassing `BuildUrl`'s internal branch/commit fallback. Fix: call `GetCurrentBranch()`/`GetCurrentCommit()` explicitly in `OpenBranch`/`OpenCommit` when the arg is still empty after the visual check (**f6e2a6e**)

#### Phase 5 — Documentation and .opencode/ updates (this session)
19. Updated `README.md`:
    - Commands table: clarified `OpenGitBranch`/`OpenGitCommit` with visual mode behavior; added `:Gitk`/`:GitkFile` aliases
    - Added "Visual Mode Support for OpenGitBranch and OpenGitCommit" section
    - Added visual mode usage examples and keymaps for branch/commit
    - Added troubleshooting entry for fugitive virtual buffers
20. Updated `doc/git_open.txt`:
    - `:OpenGitBranch` and `:OpenGitCommit` entries now document normal mode vs. visual mode behavior
    - Added `:Gitk` and `:GitkFile` alias entries
    - Added fugitive virtual buffer troubleshooting entry
    - Version bumped to 1.2.0
21. Updated `CHANGELOG.md` — added Version 1.3.0 section covering all Session 4 work
22. Updated `.opencode/agent.md` — commands table updated with gitk commands/aliases; discoveries #25–#29 added
23. Updated `.opencode/skill.md` — added `GetGitRoot` 3-step detection pattern and `OpenBranch`/`OpenCommit` fallback pattern; added reminders #11–#13
24. Updated `.opencode/conversation-log.md` — Session 4 entries added; discoveries list extended to #29; commit table updated
25. Updated `.opencode/conversation-transcript.md` (this file) — Session 4 transcript added
26. Copied all changed files to both installed locations and committed/pushed
